 I've been thinking of writing essays or short stories and eventually publishing a book for some time.
 
 And I guess having a blog would be a good start. Blogs are much more casual, after all. I can write whatever I like and pretend someone will read it.
 
 The fact is, I probably can't even write great blog posts. 
 
 So...This is it.
