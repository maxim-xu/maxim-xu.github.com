I'm far from a master of Adobe Illustrator (or Sketch), let alone a logo designer. But 
if I just copy or buy a logo from somewhere else for the studio I own (even virtually), that'll be totally lame. 

For designing a logo, it's common to find interesting patterns from outside resources, such as 
photos, which could be a great source of inspiration. The other day I ran into this photo by [Laura Tidwell](https://www.flickr.com/photos/expeditions/6811371268/in/dateposted/), a Flickr friend of mine:

<img style="width:100%;display:inline-block" alt="Low Fidelity Photo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/1.jpg" />

Despite faving it immediately because of the smooth gradient color and stunning reflection, I also found that the far-side little 
brother might be a good symbol for the logo because he seemed so relaxed yet _dynamic_. After doing some __image tracing__ 
in Illustrator, I did, eventually, get a quite impressive output.
 
<img style="width:48%;display:inline-block" alt="Low Fidelity Photo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/lf.gif" />
<img style="width:48%;display:inline-block; margin-left: 2%" alt="16 Color Photo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/16color.gif" />
<img style="width:48%;display:inline-block; margin-left: 0" alt="6 Color Photo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/6color.gif" />
<img style="width:48%;display:inline-block; margin-left: 2%" alt="3 Color Photo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/3color.gif" />

From a _low fidelity photo_ to _16 color_, _6 color_ and _3 color_ image in just a few clicks, it 
already looks so smooth! Finally it should come with a b&w version, of course, since I just want this to be 
a two-color result. 

<img style="width:48%;display:inline-block; margin-left:0" alt="bw Photo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/bw.gif" />
<img style="width:48%;display:inline-block; margin-left:2px" alt="bw1 Photo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/bw1.gif" />

After reducing the __threshold__ value which determines how much of the image results in white and how much results in black when tracing as black and white, 
I came up with the image above (right). Then I used the __Eraser tool__ to remove the unnecessary reflection and the __Pen tool__ to 
make the vector even smoother, followed by drawing a circle to hold the shape - done! Now I just need to fill in some neutral 
colors as well as add some text, which I did:

<img style="width:50%;display:block; margin:0 auto" alt="final logo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/1.png" />

If you like, you can further animate your logo like I did in After Effects, which really works well with Illustrator.
 
<img style="width:50%;min-width:300px;display:block; margin:0 auto" alt="final logo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/1.gif" />

This way, I've created a <s>completely</s> original logo for myself!
