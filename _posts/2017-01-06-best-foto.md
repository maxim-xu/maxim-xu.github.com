This photo above happens to be my shot of 2016. It was taken at _Castel Hill Lighthouse, Newport, RI_. Would love to see an HDR version of this picture.

In case you want to see my **best shot of 2015**... ta da!

This shot was taken at _Maeda Forest Park_ near _Teine, Sapporo_. I kinda love its symmetry in asymmetry.
