I tend to avoid Airbnb when I go on a vacation since its risk is always higher than chain hotels, but after my
recent airbnb experience I just
realized how much fun I had missed because of this.

Two weeks ago we (me and my friends) spent a fantastic weekend in _Newry, Maine_ where we
rented an Airbnb house and drove all the way from Boston for 3 hours - just to taste a
bit of nature. 

This place, although in Maine, was actually quite close to the White Mountains area in New Hampshire. Acadia was naturally our initial plan,
but it was too touristy (and far and expensive) for __a group
of 10__ who spend most of the time together playing board games. Yes, we drive more than
200 miles to find a place for playing board games!

The house was recently renovated so it looked incredibly new. Unfortunately, it had irritating chemical smell upon our arrival.
We opened all windows and doors for a while, then the odor was gone and we did find this place
quite cozy and interesting.

After our house tour, the living room immediately became our favourite spot. Great
view and light, large space and fireplace, lovely furniture, we could really see ourselves sitting here
playing all day - and we did!

We played _Splendor_, _Risk_, and _Mahjong_ (麻将) and it was all fun and games until someone
finally got hungry. In fact, cooking was the biggest problem here - you had to drive a dozen miles
to buy materials. Luckily we brought whatever we need for a two-day trip - all we ever needed was
just drinks and noodles!

We cooked the delicious 炸酱面 (noodles with soybean sauce) and it was a treasure. 

We did go hiking around and it was also much fun. Overall this airbnb experience
was extremely wonderful and we unanimously agree that we would do a similar trip to Vermont
in the foliage season this year.
