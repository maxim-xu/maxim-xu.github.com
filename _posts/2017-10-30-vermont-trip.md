Be it Airbnb or a vacation house where we would stay, we had high expectations for Vermont in autumn. It didn't disappoint us.

But before all that dreamy foliage thing...We visited the Teddy Bear factory in Burlington VT to put ourselves in 
retrospect for a little while.

After the Teddy tour, we enjoyed the sunset at Waterfront in Burlington downtown. A very peaceful and relaxing place.

Our vacation house was in Waterbury, not far from Stowe which is a famous town for skiing and sightseeing. The view was 
amazing even from the inside.
