# Planning

For this trip, I booked two return award tickets from Boston to Fukuoka for my wife and myself - one booked with _Marriot Bonvoy_ points (transfered to _Japanese Airlines mileage_ with some bonus), the other with _Alaska Mileage_ directly. I'm not going into the details here but booking with JAL miles directly has a few advantages, the top two being:

- You can book multi stop tickets (e.g. JFK - NRT - FUK) with the same amount of miles as just flying to Tokyo
- You will have more available dates & seats for award tickets than booking with partner airlines

The business (aka _Sky Suite_) class comes with the 787 plane is pretty comfortable, but a bit dated. If you are based in New York, the first class suite in JL5 / JL6 will be much fancier and thus worthier of redemption.

# Arriving at Fukuoka

We arrived around 9pm, picked up our sedan at _Budget Car Rental Fukuoka AirPort_, which was the only rental shop open after 8pm.

</figure>

It was February, the coldest month in Kyushu so I added the extra snow tires, but it turned out to be not necessary. The road conditions were pretty good even in mountain areas in Kyushu and there was timely snow removal in all major roads.

I will probably skip snow tires in Kyushu next time to be able to book a wider range of rental car categories.

# Hita

Hita (日田), a small city in Oita prefecture, is our first destination after a night's rest in Fukuoka. We used it as our mid-day stop during our drive to Beppu. Traditional inns with hot springs sit beside Hita's Mikuma River. There are Edo-era buildings in the Mamedamachi district and at the Kangien Academy Ruins.

<figure class="inline">
 <img oncontextmenu="return false;" class="vertical-long-img" alt="Hita" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/japan2020/hita/3.jpg" />  
</figure>

We wandered on the streets of Hita for a bit after lunch of Unagi Bento, then hit on road again. Apparently we missed the opportunity to explore Hita area a bit more and enjoy the onsens here, so I think we would stay for at least one night when we return.

Some unique ryokans in the area:

- [琴平温泉 旅籠 かやうさぎ](http://www.kayausagi.jp/)
- [ホテル風早](http://www.kazahaya.com/)
- [楓乃木](https://yabakei-funoki.net/) (Japanese Ryokan with French dinner!)

<br>

## Beppu and Kunisaki Peninsula

The drive to Beppu through Oita Expressway (大分自動車道) passes the scenic Mount Yufu, which will be introduced later in this post.

<small>I uploaded some of my videos to YouTube and embedded them here so that I don't need to host them on my own blog server.</small>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q3rFWPjxH3M?modestbranding=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p></p>

Beppu is a famous onsen resort city in Japan. Not long before our arrival, it hosted Rugby World Cup 2019, which boosted its international fame as well as improved facilities to welcome foreigners.

</figure>

Ocean cities with mountains in its back always tend to be charming, let alone Beppu is one of the biggest onsen resort towns in entire Japan. It is probably my favourate city in Kyushu. We stayed at two properties in Beppu to enjoy the different types of scenery (city view / ocean view).

</figure>

Beppu is also very close to Kunisaki Peninsula (国東半島), a peninsula with rich history and many interesting sightseeing spots. During the second day at Beppue, we visited Kitsuki, Futago-ji (両子寺) (center of the penisula), Bungotakada (豊後高田) and Usa (宇佐), all short drives between each other. I referred to this [note](https://www.douban.com/note/572838940/) (written in _Chinese_) a lot when I made my travel plans for this area.

<br>

## Kitsuki

Kitsuki is a small quiet city in Oita that overlooks the Beppu Bay. It is famous for its Jōkamachi (城下町, "castle town"), which is a historic site very suitable for a walk.

<figure class="inline">

    <figcaption>Kitsuki Castle</figcaption>
</figure>

After Kitsuki, we did a 30-minutes drive to Futago-ji (両子寺), the iconic temple at the center of Rokugo-Manzan (六郷満山, name of the mountain in the peninsula).

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZItEF-nmkvM?modestbranding=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<br>

## Futago-ji

The best season to visit Rokugo-Manzan (六郷満山) is the fall, in which the temples and shrines will be decorated with lots of amazing foliage. Plus, it will be way less crowded than other famous foliage spots in Japan (Kyoto, for example).

<figure class="inline">

    <figcaption>Futago-ji</figcaption>
</figure>

After a respectful visit to Futago-ji, we headed to Bungotakada, a small city that became known because a famous [movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracles_of_the_Namiya_General_Store) was filmed there.

<br>

## Bungotakada

    <figcaption>Bungotakada</figcaption>
</figure>

There weren't much to see other than that shopping street, so we didn't stay for too long in Bungotakada.

<br>

## Usa

We visited this part of the peninsula also to avoid taking the same route back to Beppu. The prestigious shrine Usa Jingu (宇佐神宮) is only ~10 minutes drive from Bungotakada. We were the only visitors when we arrived at the shrine.

<figure class="inline">

</figure>

It is probably not necessary to stay overnight in Usa (especially if you travel by a rental car), but if you do, I found a local [guesthouse](https://www.naruguesthouse.com/naru) that seems to be worth a try.

<br>

## Beppu City

After a day trip to Kunisaki Peninsula, we returned to Beppu city and chose to stay at [REX HOTEL Beppu](http://rexhotel-beppu.co.jp/) for our second night. The property was stunningly new and clean - to an extent where all guests need to took off their shoes before entering the hotel building. Taking off shoes is somewhat common for traditional Japanese ryokans, but for a modern multi-level building? This was a first for me.

- [Terrace Midoubaru (テラス御堂原)](midoubaru)
- [InterContinental - ANA Beppu Resort & Spa](https://www.ihg.com/intercontinental/hotels/jp/ja/beppu/oitky/hoteldetail)

As mentioned above, Beppu is a city known for its natural hot springs - more interestingly - its _hells_ (地獄). The [Hells of Beppu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hells_of_Beppu) are only for viewing rather than bathing, and they are a must see if you visit the area.

</figure>

Time didn't allow us to visit all of the famous _seven hells of Beppu_ (each of which is considered to be unique), but you probably get the idea. At the noon of our third day in Beppu, we headed south to Yufuin (由布院), another famous onsen town in Oita prefecture.

<br>

## Yufuin

The drive from Beppu to Yufuin (Prefecture Route 11) is very relaxing and scenic - you either drive in a wooded area with trees on both sides, or you drive on a wide open road with mountains in your eyes.

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hSg5vK3NhNs?modestbranding=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p></p>
Even in winter, the scenery was quite amazing. If you decide to take a train, make sure to take the [Yufuin no Mori (ゆふいんの森)](https://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/english/train/yufuin_no_mori.html) JR train to enjoy the ride.
<p></p>

<p></p>
Yufuin is a hot springs resort town surrounded by rich variety of nature. The most prominent feature of Yufuin's skyline is the twin peaked Mount Yufu, which hovers over the town and serves as the backdrop for many scenic views.

<figure>
 <img oncontextmenu="return false;" alt="Yufuin" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/japan2020/yufuin/1.jpg" />  
  <figcaption>Mount Yufu in the background</figcaption>   
</figure>

The ryokan and hotels of Yufuin are spread out around town, and not clustered along the main street like in many other resort towns. Instead, the main street is lined with cafes, boutiques and small museums, giving Yufuin an atmosphere more like a trendy shopping area than a traditional onsen town. Nonetheless, there is a large number of lodgings with hot spring baths, some of which open their baths to non-staying guests during daytime. <sup>1</sup>

</figure>

We had our lunch in a handmade Soba noodle shop near Kinrin Lake (金鱗湖), which is a small pond famous for its morning mists. I was not able to take a very impressive photo of the lake though.

<figure class="inline">
 <img oncontextmenu="return false;"  class="vertical-long-img" alt="Yufuin" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/japan2020/yufuin/6.jpg" /> 
    <figcaption>Kinrin Lake</figcaption>
</figure>

On the streets of Yufuin, A lot of local shops were open to sell souvenirs, dessert and all kinds of art pieces, so a walk there would be really nice.

We didn't spend a night in Yufuin, unfortunately - even though hours were spent on hotel researching in Yufuin, I decided to stay in Kurokawa due to our tight schedule. That was a pity, of course, just imagine laying down in a private open-air bath with a Mount Yufu view... It would be a memorable stay.

Some recommended ryokans in Yufuin:

<br>

## Kurokawa

Yet another onsen resort town - Kurokawa is located in the middle of Kyushu about 20 kilometers north of Mount Aso. The drive to Kurokawa took longer than I expected, and we were late to check in at our ryokan at Kurokawa.

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ncFVqnemOo?modestbranding=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p></p>

The townscape is dominated by natural colors and materials, wooden buildings, earthen walls, stone stairs and a river flowing through. The town center, located in a forested valley, is compact and easily explored on foot, except for a few ryokan which are located less centrally (like ours).<sup>2</sup>

<figure class="inline">

</figure>

Like many old onsen towns in Japan, Kurokawa's narrow streets can barely allow a car to pass through. Luckily, the town is quite small so it's perfectly accessible by foot.

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbDdk7xG_tc?modestbranding=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p></p>

Due to limited space, I will introduce the ryokan we stayed at, [Takefue](http://www.takefue.com/english/index.html), in a standalone post. After a luxury stay at Takefue, we left Kurokawa and continued heading south into Aso.

<br>

## Aso

Mount Aso (阿蘇山, Asosan) is an active volcano in the center of Kyushu. Its caldera ranks among the world's largest, with a diameter of up to 25 kilometers and a circumference of over 100 kilometers.<sup>3</sup>

<figure class="inline">
 <img oncontextmenu="return false;"  class="vertical-long-img" alt="Aso" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/japan2020/aso/1.png" /> 
    <figcaption>flat rice fields in Aso</figcaption>
</figure>

We decided to have lunch in Aso city, and our route would pass Shiroyama Viewpoint, a famous lookout that offers nice views of the flat rice fields of Aso. Regretfully, for some reason I forgot to stop at the viewpoint, missing a great opportunity for some breathtaking photos.

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sR03ryL8Ekw?modestbranding=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p></p>

The must-see attraction in the area is definitely the Aso-Kuju National Park (阿蘇くじゅう国立公園), however due to our tight schedule (again), I decided to skip it for our next Kyushu trip, and save the time for other spots instead. Winter is not the best season to enjoy the volcano national park anyway, I said to myself.

We hiked in Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu Shrine (上色見熊野座神社), a shrine that requires visitors to walk up a long staircase decorated with moss covered stone lanterns through a cathedral like forest of cedar trees. We also visited Shirakawa Suigen (白川水源), a famous fountainhead offering ultra clear mineral water that bubbles up from underneath the earth.

<figure class="inline">

    <figcaption>Wakka's guest house</figcaption>
</figure>

There are many choices of lodging in the area. After a luxury night in Kurokawa Onsen, and with frugality in mind, we chose to stay at [Wakka](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/wakka.html), a family-owned guesthouse that overlooks Mount Aso in Minamiaso (南阿蘇).

<figure class="inline small">
 <img oncontextmenu="return false;"  class="vertical-long-img" alt="Wakka guest room" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/japan2020/aso/3.jpg" />

    <figcaption>Homemade dinner for us</figcaption>
</figure>

The guest room was basic but had everything necessary. The owners of the guesthouse, a Japanese couple in their 50s, were super welcoming and kind. The price was very reasonable and it also included a homemade dinner and breakfast, which was nice. After this countryside stay, we took national route 325 (国道 325 号) to explore west Kyushu, instead of going further south into Kumamoto.

## Takachiho

Takachiho Gorge (高千穂峡, Takachiho-kyō) is a narrow chasm cut through the rock by the Gokase River. The nearly sheer cliffs lining the gorge are made of slow forming volcanic basalt columns which resemble the scales of a dragon where the stone twisted and flowed as it formed.<sup>4</sup>

Before Takachiho Gorge though, we had a quick stop at Kunimigaoka Viewing Platform (国見ヶ丘展望台) - an observation deck to see the sea of clouds. Unfortunately the weather was not cooperative, so there was not much to see here.

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jK2jScI2NBk?modestbranding=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p></p>

Visitors can enjoy the gorge from two perspectives. The first is from below which is done by rowing down the river. Rental boats are available at the south end of the gorge, and the water is calm and easy to navigate. This highly recommended route offers a close up view of the cliffs and waterfall.

The second perspective, from above, is done by walking the paved path that runs along the edge of the gorge. There are beautiful views all along the way and at some points on the trail you can look practically straight down to the river below. The trail continues for about one kilometer, eventually leading to the Takachiho Shrine.

The gorge was very pretty even in winter, but I think it will be much more colorful in other seasons.

Takachiho, or rather Miyazaki Prefecture in general, is famous for many local products, including Wagyu.

After a very delicious A5 Wagyu BBQ lunch, we headed to another tourist attraction in Takechiho, Amano Yasukawara (天安河原).

It is said to be the cave where the gods and goddesses met to discuss their strategy of luring Amaterasu out of hiding. The natural beauty of the cave and river lined by countless stacks of stones make Amano Yasukawara a place not to miss. <sup>5</sup>

Follow the walking path by the Iwato River in Amano Yasukawara, you will reach Amano Iwato Shrine (天岩戸神社), where neat little piles of stones stacked along the river by previous visitors to mark their pilgrimage to this "power spot". Further along, the stacks become more numerous until you are surrounded by literally thousands of them as far as you can see.

Again, as sacred as the shrine was, I think this place would be much more beautiful if visited in a season other than winter.

After a relaxing walk in Amano Yasukawara, we started the engine to drive onto National Route 218 (国道 218 号) to further east, in the direction of our next stop - Hyuga.
