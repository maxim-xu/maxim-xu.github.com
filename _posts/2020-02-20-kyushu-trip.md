# Planning

I booked two return award tickets from Boston to Fukuoka for my wife and myself this time. One booked with _Marriot Bonvoy_ points (transfered to _Japanese Airlines mileage_ with some bonus), the other booked with _Alaska Mileage_ directly. I'm not going into the details but booking with JAL miles directly does have a few advantages, the top two being:

- You can book multi stop tickets with the same amount of miles as just flying to Tokyo
- You will have more available dates & seats for award tickets than booking with partner airlines

# Arriving at Fukuoka

We arrived around 9pm, and picked up our sedan at _Budget Car Rental Fukuoka AirPort_, which was the only rental shop open after 8pm.

It was February, the coldest month in Kyushu so I added the extra snow tires, but it turns out not necessary. The road conditions are pretty good even in mountain areas in Kyushu and there will be timely snow removal in all major roads.

I will probably skip snow tires in Kyushu next time to be able to book a wider range of rental car categories.

# Hita

Hida (日田) is a small city in Oita prefecture. We used it as our mid-day stop during our drive to Beppu. Traditional inns with hot springs sit beside its Mikuma River. There are Edo-era buildings in the Mamedamachi district and at the Kangien Academy Ruins.

We wandered on the streets of Hita for a bit after lunch for Unagi Bento, then hit on road again. Apparently we missed the opportunity to explore Hita area a bit more and enjoy the onsens here, so I think we would stay for at least one night when we return.

Some unique ryokans in the area:

- [ホテル風早](http://www.kazahaya.com/)
- [楓乃木](https://yabakei-funoki.net/) (Japanese Ryokan with French dinner!)

## Beppu

Beppu in Oita Prefecture has been a famous onsen town in Japan. Not long before our arrival, Beppu hosted Rugby World Cup 2019, which boosted its international fame as well as improved facilities to welcome foreigners.

Ocean cities with mountains in its back always tend to be popular, let alone Beppu is one of the biggest onsen towns in entire Japan. We stayed at two properties in Beppu to enjoy the different scenery (city view / ocean view).
