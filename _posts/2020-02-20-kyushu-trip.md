# Planning

I booked two return award tickets from Boston to Fukuoka for my wife and myself this time. One booked with _Marriot Bonvoy_ points (transfered to _Japanese Airlines mileage_ with some bonus), the other booked with _Alaska Mileage_ directly. I'm not going into the details here but booking with JAL miles directly does have a few advantages, the top two being:

- You can book multi stop tickets with the same amount of miles as just flying to Tokyo
- You will have more available dates & seats for award tickets than booking with partner airlines

The business (aka _Sky Suite_) class comes with the 787 plane is pretty comfortable, but a bit dated. If you are based in New York, the first class suite in JL5 / JL6 will be much fancier and thus worthier of redemption.

# Arriving at Fukuoka

We arrived around 9pm, and picked up our sedan at _Budget Car Rental Fukuoka AirPort_, which was the only rental shop open after 8pm.

It was February, the coldest month in Kyushu so I added the extra snow tires, but it turns out not necessary. The road conditions are pretty good even in mountain areas in Kyushu and there will be timely snow removal in all major roads.

I will probably skip snow tires in Kyushu next time to be able to book a wider range of rental car categories.

# Hita

Hida (日田) is a small city in Oita prefecture. We used it as our mid-day stop during our drive to Beppu. Traditional inns with hot springs sit beside its Mikuma River. There are Edo-era buildings in the Mamedamachi district and at the Kangien Academy Ruins.

</figure>

We wandered on the streets of Hita for a bit after lunch for Unagi Bento, then hit on road again. Apparently we missed the opportunity to explore Hita area a bit more and enjoy the onsens here, so I think we would stay for at least one night when we return.

Some unique ryokans in the area:

- [琴平温泉 旅籠 かやうさぎ](http://www.kayausagi.jp/)
- [ホテル風早](http://www.kazahaya.com/)
- [楓乃木](https://yabakei-funoki.net/) (Japanese Ryokan with French dinner!)

## Beppu and Kunisaki Peninsula

Beppu in Oita Prefecture has been a famous onsen town in Japan. Not long before our arrival, Beppu hosted Rugby World Cup 2019, which boosted its international fame as well as improved facilities to welcome foreigners.

Ocean cities with mountains in its back always tend to be charming, let alone Beppu is one of the biggest onsen towns in entire Japan. It is probably my favourate city in Kyushu - you will see why below. We stayed at two properties in Beppu to enjoy the different sceneries (city view / ocean view).

Beppu is also very close to Kunisaki Peninsula (国東半島), a peninsula with rich history and many interesting sightseeing spots. During the second day at Beppue, we visited Kitsuki, Futago-ji (両子寺) (center of the penisula), Bungotakada (豊後高田) and Usa (宇佐), all short drives between each other. I referred to this [note](https://www.douban.com/note/572838940/) (written in _Chinese_) a lot when I made my travel plans for this area.

## Kitsuki

Kitsuki is a small quiet city in Oita that overlooks the Beppu Bay. It is famous for its Jōkamachi (城下町, "castle town"), which is a historic site very suitable for a walk.

After Kitsuki, we did a 30-minutes drive to Futago-ji (両子寺), the iconic temple at the center of Rokugo-Manzan (六郷満山, name of the mountain in the peninsula).

<small>I uploaded some of my videos to YouTube and embedded them here so that I don't need to host them on my own blog server.</small>

## Futago-ji

The best season to visit Rokugo-Manzan (六郷満山) is the Fall, in which the temples and shrines will be decorated with lots of amazing foliage. Plus, it will be way less crowded than other famous foliage spots in Japan (Kyoto, for example).

    <figcaption>Futago-ji</figcaption>
</figure>

After a respectful visit to Futago-ji, we headed to Bungotakada, a small city that became known because a famous [movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracles_of_the_Namiya_General_Store) was filming there.

## Bungotakada

</figure>

There weren't much to see other than that shopping street, so we didn't stay for too long in Bungotakada.

## Usa

We visited this part of the peninsula also to avoid taking the same road back to Beppu. The prestigious shrine Usa Jingu (宇佐神宮) is only ~10 minutes drive from Bungotakada. We were the only visitors when we arrived at the shrine.

## Beppu City

After a day trip to Kunisaki Peninsula, we returned to Beppu city and chose to stay at [REX HOTEL Beppu](http://rexhotel-beppu.co.jp/) for our second night. The property was stunningly new and clean - to an extent where all guests need to took off their shoes before entering the hotel building. Taking off shoes is somewhat common for traditional Japanese ryokans, but for a modern multi-level building? This was a first for me.

Some unique hotels in Beppu city:

- [Amane Resort Seikai (潮騒の宿 晴海)](https://www.seikai.co.jp/)
- [Amane Resort Gahama Terrace](https://gahamaterrace.com/)
- [Sanso Kannawaen (山荘 神和苑)](http://kannawaen.jp)
- [Terrace Midoubaru (テラス御堂原)](midoubaru)
- [InterContinental - ANA Beppu Resort & Spa](https://www.ihg.com/intercontinental/hotels/jp/ja/beppu/oitky/hoteldetail)

As mentioned above, Beppu is a city known for its natural hot springs - more interestingly - its _hells_ (地獄). The [Hells of Beppu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hells_of_Beppu) are only for viewing rather than bathing, and they are a must see if you visit the area.

Time didn't allow us to visit all of the famous _seven hells of Beppu_ (each of which is considered to be unique), but you probably get the idea. At the noon of our third day in Beppu, we headed south to Yufuin (由布院), another famous onsen town in Oita prefecture.

## Yufuin

The drive from Beppu to Yufuin (Prefecture Route 11) is very relaxing and scenic - you either drive in a wooded area with trees on both sides, or you drive on a wide open road with mountains in your eyes.

<p></p>
Even in winter, the scenery was quite amazing. If you decide to take a train, make sure to take the [Yufuin no Mori (ゆふいんの森)](https://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/english/train/yufuin_no_mori.html) JR train to enjoy the ride.

Yufuin is a hot springs resort town surrounded by rich variety of nature.
