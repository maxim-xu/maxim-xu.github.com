I don't want to pretend that this was a just a casual trip. In fact, I never thought I would have a chance to
 go on a road trip in Japan before 30. It's really a dream come true.

I was excited after arriving from a 12-hour long flight, Japan Airlines' JL7 (BOS - NRT) on Dec 29, two days before the New Year's Eve. 
It's not my first visit to Japan, it certainly won't be the last one (who knows), but it would be my first road trip. I knew it would be fun driving in Japan.

But driving in Tokyo? Not so much. Expensive toll fees and parking problems could be painful, not to mention the heavy daily traffic.
 Plus, Tokyo already has probably the most convenient (and sophisticated) metro system in the world.


# Tokyo

I had a _wild_ plan of staying for more than 6 days in Tokyo - turned out it was barely enough.
 Tokyo is more than just a metropolitan city - it's a little universe. Food, people, nature and tradition harmoniously
  co-exist here. No, they are more than just existing - they're delicately functioning.
