Yes I'm talking about the drones from DJI.

When it comes to cameras or lenses (a drone is no more than an aerial camera to me), I don't buy them based on reviews.
I buy them because of the outputs. 

I've been subscribing a YouTube channel named [Shinji kawamura](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClSREl_LUSDMrVlEhERqsNQ) 
for a while and everytime he has a new drone video it'll literally stun me. Everytime. Check out the video below if you don't believe me.

So broad. The video was taken by DJI's Phantom 4 and it's 60FPS & 4K! Absolutely amazing quality and the turnarounds are smooth. I can 
easily tell that the drone is super stable without flying it myself.

Imagine the scene when I use a drone in the **foliage season** (I live in New England)...
It'll probably look like this:

or this:

Looks really exciting. 

Sad news is that starting from this year, [FAA](https://registermyuas.faa.gov/) requires that every single drone device
be registered before it can be legally flying outdoors. This is likely gonna take some time so I guess I should get one no later than August.

I missed last fall, so I really want to be fully prepared this year!
