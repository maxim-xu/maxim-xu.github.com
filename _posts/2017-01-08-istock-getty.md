Well...Sort of.

A couple of weeks ago I applied [here](https://workwithus.gettyimages.com/en/submit-your-work) to 
become an individual contributor for [Getty Images](http://www.gettyimages.com/). Today, when I almost forgot that - an unexpected 
notification arrived:

> Congratulations! The editing team here have been through your submissions and think you might be very promising as a future iStocker! We would like to offer you an invitation to share your talents and apply to become an iStock by Getty Images contributor.
 
"What? What? Seriously?!"

[iStock](http://www.istockphoto.com/) is a microstock affiliate of Getty Images. For many amateurs, it's most likely
the first step to become a _real_ Getty Images contributor. 

To be honest, I didn't really expect to get an approval, not even from iStock. After all, I just 
bought an 'amateurish' APS-C camera - my Sony a6000 - less than a year ago. And I have 
only uploaded less than 160 public photos on Flickr, which, by all means, are my total __presentable__
photos.

You can probably see why I feel so encouraged now. The recognition from a prestigious stock provider 
does give me a lot of confidence - one more _professional player_ out there!

Besides the congratulation, the notification email also contains three embedded images of the pictures
that I uploaded previously, each along with a code - seems like these three have 
passed the editor's review. I have listed them below:

A good subject might really help you win in the application process.
