Well...Sort of.

A couple of weeks ago I applied [here](https://workwithus.gettyimages.com/en/submit-your-work) to 
become an individual contributor for [Getty Images](http://www.gettyimages.com/). Today, when I almost forgot that - an unexpected 
notification arrived:

> Congratulations! The editing team here have been through your submissions and think you might be very promising as a future iStocker! We would like to offer you an invitation to share your talents and apply to become an iStock by Getty Images contributor.
 
"What? What? Seriously?!"

[iStock](http://www.istockphoto.com/) is a microstock affiliate of Getty Images. For many amateurs, it's most likely
the first step to become a _real_ Getty Images contributor. 

To be honest, I didn't really expect to get an approval, not even from iStock. After all, I just 
bought an 'amateurish' APS-C camera - my Sony a6000 - less than a year ago. And I have 
only uploaded less than 160 public photos on Flickr, which, by all means, are my total __presentable__
photos.

You can probably see why I feel so encouraged now. The recognition from a prestigious stock provider 
does give me a lot of confidence - another _professional player_ out there!

Besides the congratulation, the notification email also contains three embedded images of the pictures
that I uploaded previously, each along with a code - seems like these three have 
passed the editor's review. I have listed them below:

<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A good subject might really help you win in the application process.

Update*: It seems that iStock is full of both photographers and 'wanna-be' photographers now. After
doing some research, I realize that I was just over excited. Though the market has no sign of gloom and doom, 
the chance to get yourself some notice on iStock is little. Downloads, which means profit from royalties, will very likely   be negligible too.
