On a warm Saturday in April I visited **Woonsocket**, a small town in north Rhode Island where
 the film _Hachi: A Dog's Tale_ was filmed. I always wanted to go there because it's really close to 
 where I'm living now, plus a group of fans and dog lovers even made a _Hachi Trail_(see below) that has all noticeable filming places in it.

 Following the trail map I was astonished that the town even put a Hachi statue in front of the train station, and I was able to rebuild the image and establish a connection to this touching film. Here is what I got:

 <img alt="hachi1" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/hachi1.jpg" />
 <img alt="hachi2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/hachi2.jpg" />
 <img alt="hachi3" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/hachi3.jpg" /> 
 <img alt="hachi5" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/hachi5.jpg" />
 <img alt="hachi6" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/hachi6.jpg" />
 
 It's well worth the drive.
