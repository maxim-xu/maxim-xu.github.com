I've been to only a few states in the U.S., but have already learned that almost every state (region, at least) has its unique
 natural features and cultural characteristics. And sometimes they're so different.
 
New England is famous for its history and open, broad mind - Liberalism, perhaps. Oh and the colorful
 Autumn, of course. Although I feel sad that I' m thousands of miles
away from my homeland, living in the New England area has always been a pleasant thing, especially
 for readers like me. Just knowing the fact that many of my favorite authors and writers have or had
 been living so close to me makes me happy.
 
Stephen King's scary house stands in Bangor, Maine. Bill Bryson (who wrote _A Walk in the Woods_) had lived in New Hampshire for years 
before he finally moved to England. Springfield, MA is known for its Dr.Seuss museum, whilst 'the road not taken' is 
actually being taken frequently in Vermont. Even Thoreau's cabin beside Walden Pond can still accommodate
 travellers.
 
Among the countless writers influenced by Thoreau, E.B.White was a very notable one. He even
 had a cabin similar to Thoreau's, as shown in the image below:

E.B.White moved from New York to Maine in 1938, at a point when he was far from being successful or rich.
 He said: 
 
> I would really rather feel bad in Maine than feel good anywhere else.

He really loved Maine.

I still remember when I was reading his _Charlotte's Web_, the spider Charlotte asks if there's a good word to
 describe Wilbur - her pig friend, so that she can weave it onto the web to save him. Interesting enough, my choice
 was __sensible__, thinking it's such a proper word to remind people of their ignorance and prudence. 
 But E.B.White used __radiant__, which made my realize that my choice of word was just too obvious even
 boring.
 
My English is not on the same level of E.B.White's, of course, but I always think trying to 
replace a word in a sentence is a good way to remember it as well as practice and improve language skills.

A friend of mine reviewed his essays as "innocent, sensitive, liberal and wonderful". I quite agree - just want
 to add "in a professional way" at the end.
